         review: "I couldn't be more impressed with my new Kaekoo Rosetta pillow. Upon receiving it, I was thoroughly impressed just by the packaging. Everything fit so perfectly in the box and was so elegantly designed, down to even the sticker on the tissue paper. The fabric and leather is a perfect blend of live-able and stylish. Everything has been sewn so well and seems so durable! I couldn't have been more excited to get it on my couch. It's very obvious that Kaeley has thought every single thing through when she created these pillows; the designs, fabric, colors, etc. I will most certainly be buying more! Thanks Kaekoo! ",
